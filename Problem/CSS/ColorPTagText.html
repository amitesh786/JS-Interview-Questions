<!-- What will be the color of the <p> text in the following scenario? -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

        p {
            color: red;
        }
        div p {
            color: blue;

        #unique {

<!-- p { color: red; } → This sets all <p> elements to red.

div p { color: blue; } → This has higher level than the first rule, so normally it would override it.

.special { color: purple; } → This targets elements with class special, but it has the same 
level as div p (class selector and element selector both count as specificity of (0,1,1)), so it would apply normally.

#unique { color: green !important; } → Since #unique is an ID selector (which has higher specificity 
than class or element selectors) and it uses !important, it will override all other rules.

Thus, the final computed color for the <p> element is green. -->
