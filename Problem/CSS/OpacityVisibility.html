<!-- How will the .box1 and .box2 behave with their respective opacity and visibility styles? -->

<!-- Explanation:
opacity: 0.5 makes .box1 semi-transparent, meaning it’s visible but with 50% opacity.

visibility: hidden hides .box2, making it not visible, but it still takes up space in the layout (it’s not removed from the flow like with display: none). -->

<!-- Answer:
.box1 will be semi-transparent with 50% opacity but will still be visible.

.box2 will be invisible, but it will still occupy space on the page (due to visibility: hidden). -->
